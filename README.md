Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client who had an android only game called Draw It or Lose it, and they wanted me to design the game to be available on other platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I was able to identify and recommend a solution(cloud based) to the client particularly well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It leaves no room for ambiguity, when you have the design document, both you and the client know exactly what to expect from each other.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would have updated the final recommendations to have a little more detail as to why I picked each platform.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the user's desire to be able to select their team names, and save them into the database. It is important to consider the user's needs because they are the one's who are actually using the product that you create. If you don't create something that they want, or that will help them, then why would they pay you for it?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software by first identifying what the client wanted, researching and deciding on solutions that made everyone happy, and then developed accordingly. I would continue to use this strategy going forward, because it keeps everyone on the same page, so that both the devvelopers and the clients are happy with the final delivered product.
